# End-to-End-Data-Engineering-Pipeline
Designed and implemented an end-to-end data engineering pipeline that collects raw data via web scraping, processes it with Apache Spark, and stores it in a Delta Lakehouse. Automated workflows with Dagster for batch and incremental processing, built dashboards in Superset, and deployed in a containerized, scalable environment.
