# End-to-End Data Engineering Pipeline

## Overview

This project implements a **fully automated end-to-end data engineering pipeline** that covers the entire data lifecycle, both **locally and on AWS**.  

- **Data Ingestion**: Collecting raw data through web scraping  
- **Data Processing**: Cleaning and transforming data using **Apache Spark**  
- **Data Storage**: Storing structured data in a **Delta Lakehouse** (local or on **Amazon S3**)  
- **AWS Integration**: Using **Boto3** to connect and interact with AWS services  
- **Orchestration**: Automating batch and incremental workflows with **Dagster**  
- **Data Visualization**: Building interactive dashboards in **Apache Superset**  
- **Deployment**: Running the system in a containerized environment or deploying on AWS

## AWS Architecture (Conceptual)

![AWS Architecture](A_diagram_in_the_image_illustrates_an_end-to-end_d.png)

This architecture allows data to flow seamlessly from **web scraping → AWS S3 → Spark processing → Delta Lake storage → Dagster orchestration → Superset dashboards**.

## Key Components

| Component        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Web Scraping** | Extracts raw data from online sources |
| **Spark ETL**    | Cleans, transforms, and aggregates data |
| **Delta Lake**   | ACID-compliant storage (local or on S3) |
| **AWS (Boto3)**  | Connects to AWS services such as **Amazon S3** |
| **Dagster**      | Orchestrates and schedules workflows |
| **Superset**     | Builds interactive dashboards |
| **Docker**       | Ensures scalable and portable deployments |

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.8  
- Apache Spark  
- Delta Lake libraries  
- Dagster  
- Apache Superset  
- Docker & Docker Compose  
- AWS account with IAM credentials (for AWS integration)  
- Python dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)  

---

## AWS Integration

The project includes a **Boto3Connector** class for managing AWS connections:

```python
class Boto3Connector(object):
    def __init__(self, aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key, endpoint_url):
        self.aws_access_key_id = aws_access_key_id
        self.aws_secret_access_key = aws_secret_access_key
        self.endpoint_url = endpoint_url
